## Algorithms, with a healthy dose of excitement

With this lesson, we begin our journey into algorithms.  

Pause for applause and smiles.  

First algorithm, is just a fancy word for a procedure.  Yes, it's vague.  Yes, you have been coding procedures since you've started this course.  In a typical algorithms coursework, you generally consider procedures that have been already been implemented for you in many languages.  For example, both Ruby and Javascript have a sort method, and a find method.  In our discussion, we'll explore how they work.

### Why learn algorithms

Now, the consequence of these algorithms being solved and implemented means that we accord them the proper spot in our coding brain.  They are tools all languages, and therefore, us as programmers lean on, so are important to understand how they work.  Also, the problems they solve are generic enough that we can draw parallels to them in many places, and therefore can lean on the shoulders of giants when solving a similar problem.  

So we learn algorithms because (1) our programming languages lean on them, and thus us as programmers rely on them and (2) because if we find a problem that has already been solved by an algorithm, we can apply it.  

The danger of learning algorithms is that they often ask us to consider how long a procedure takes, and this consideration can sometimes become a misplaced prioritize.  When coding, we should still have our priorities as follows:

  * Make it work
  * Make it right (ie. readable)
  * Make it fast

And with that disclaimer out of the way, let's make it fast.
